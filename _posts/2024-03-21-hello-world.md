Welcome to my first blog post! This is a sample post to demonstrate how to create content using the no-style-please Jekyll theme.

## Features of this theme

- Minimalist design
- Fast loading
- Dark/light mode support
- Focus on content

### Code Example 

```
python
def hello_world():
print("Hello, World!")
```

You can also add *italic* and **bold** text, or create lists:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
